# interview-prep

## Overview

This project is designed to help users prepare for interviews by providing a platform to manage questions and answers.<br>
It consists of a frontend built with Vue.js and a backend built with FastAPI.<br>
The project now includes Docker-based containerization and centralized logging with Loki.<br><br>
I do recommend to use tools like chatGPT for evaluation the answers<br>
by using a prompt like:
> I have an interview at \<COMPANY NAME>, I will post a question with an answer,
> as the interviewer you should give me feedback for my answer...

be creative :wink:

## Backend

The backend is developed using FastAPI. It provides a RESTful API for managing questions and answers, and handles file uploads for bulk question imports.


### Main Technologies
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/)
- [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)
- [OpenPyXL](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [python-logging-loki](https://pypi.org/project/python-logging-loki/)

### Project Setup
